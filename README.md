The ability to determine if a smaller graph is contained within a greater graph has become increasingly important. From comparing compositions of different molecular structures to the relationships between millions of users in social media, being able to solve this time-consuming problem in as little time as possible is challenging. Among the various implementations to solve this problem is VF3, a state-of-the-art graph-matching algorithm designed by Carletti et al. We propose some improvements to its runtime by making modifications to how nodes labels are searched and stored during the initial stages of the algorithm and compare our results to Carlettiâ€™s
